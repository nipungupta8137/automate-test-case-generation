To test the feature there lies many scenarios which should be tested before the software is released.
It is difficult to cover all the scenarios and also tough to write all scenarios.

*Some scenarios are as under:--
  # One item with debit card and no discount card.
  # Three items with credit card and SuperDisc card applied.
  # Similar to second scenario with four, five, six... items

The scenario list can be endless and it is not possible to write all these. This program will help create the tests using random data.


SampleInput.csv contains the test data that will be chosen randomly based on scenarios defined in SampleTestScenario.csv

This is a general example and does not need any rules. Complex problem can be controlled by different rules.
